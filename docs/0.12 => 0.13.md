# N-Vibe Navigation SDK for iOS upgrade from 0.12 to 0.13

## Simplify navigation callback

Some callback have been simplified and some have been removed.

```swift

    func navigationService(_ service: NVNavigationKit.NVNavigationService, shouldRerouteFrom location: CLLocation) -> Bool

    func navigationService(_ service: NVNavigationService, willChange progress: NVibeRouteProgress) {
        let step = progress.stepProgress.nextStep
        let stepDistance = progress.stepProgress.remainingDistance
    }
    
    func navigationService(_ service: NVNavigationService, didChange progress: NVibeRouteProgress) {
        let step = progress.stepProgress.currentStep
    }
```

## Inside maneuver property, add turn angle in hour

```swift
    let step = progress.stepProgress.nextStep.maneuver.turn_direction //Between 1 and 12
```
   
## Inside maneuver property, add details for better instructions descriptions

Type/modifier are properties to recognize type of instruction but with instruction that combine multiple sub instruction (e.g., turn left, cross and go to the right side of the street), it was not possible to properly recognize it. So we add details property to describe each sub instruction with the same way (type/modifier).

```swift
    let details = progress.stepProgress.nextStep.maneuver.details
    for detail in details {
        let instruction = detail.instruction //this is the default sub instruction
        let type = detail.type
        let modifier = detail.modifier
        let name = detail.name //this is the name of the street if needed corresponding to the instruction
    }
}
```

This is type/modifier available inside details
